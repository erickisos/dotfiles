#+TITLE: Dotfiles

Main configuration files for my shared Unix/macOS system

* Configuration files

The basic structure is the same that you would find on your home directory:

- [[docs/doom.org][Doom Config file]] contains all the doom emacs configurations in a literate programming manner
- [[file:docs/nubank.org][Nubank Config file]] contains the specific nubank configurations that would lead into these files: =.nubank_env=, =.nubank_rc=, =.nubank_aliases= and =.nubank_functions=
- =.zshrc= is the main config file for ZShell
- =.env= is a general envvar file
- =.gitconfig= contains my global configuration for Git
