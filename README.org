#+TITLE: Dotfiles

Main configuration files for my shared Unix/macOS system

* Configuration files

The basic structure is the same that you would find on your home directory:

- `.doom.d` contains all the doom emacs configurations
- `.zshrc` is the main config file for ZShell
- `.env` is a general envvar file
- `.gitconfig` contains my global configuration for Git
